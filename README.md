The project aims to provide a seamless and intuitive shopping experience for users.

In the backend, Node.js is used as the runtime environment and server-side framework. It allows for efficient handling of HTTP requests, database operations, and business logic. With Node.js, the project ensures high scalability, performance, and real-time communication capabilities.

The project leverages a database system, such as MySQL or MongoDB, to store product information, user data, and order details. Node.js interacts with the database through database drivers or ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and maintain data consistency.

EJS is used as the templating engine for the UI. It enables dynamic HTML rendering and allows for embedding JavaScript code within HTML templates. With EJS, the project can easily generate dynamic web pages based on the data retrieved from the backend.

The UI designed with EJS includes various pages such as the home page, product listings, product details, shopping cart, and checkout. EJS templates are used to create reusable components and layout structures, ensuring consistency and easy maintenance of the UI.

The project implements user authentication and authorization features to provide personalized shopping experiences. Users can create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles. Authentication middleware is employed to protect certain routes and ensure that only authorized users can access them.

Integration with payment gateways or APIs allows users to securely make online transactions. Node.js handles the communication with payment gateways, encrypts sensitive data, and ensures secure transactions.

To enhance the user experience, the project implements search and filtering functionalities, allowing users to search for specific products and apply filters based on categories, price ranges, or other attributes. Sorting options, pagination, and a responsive UI design ensure a user-friendly and efficient shopping experience across different devices.
